Youtube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit

Youtube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit project intends the user to collect data from YouTube channels using the YouTube Data API v3, store it in a MySQL database, and provide querying capabilities via a Streamlit web interface.

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python for scripting and data processing
- Google APIs Client Library for Python to interact with the YouTube Data API v3
- Streamlit for creating the web interface
- MySQL for data storage
- Streamlit used to create web page

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details,playlist details, video details, and comments.
